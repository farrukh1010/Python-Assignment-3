#   Questions

# Basic Operations

# 1.	Create a dictionary student with keys: name, age, and grade. Assign them appropriate values.


# student = {
#     "name": "Ali Khan",
#     "age": 16,
#     "grade": "A"
# }

# print(student)
   

# 2.	Access the value of the key grade in the student dictionary.


# student = {
#     "name": "Ali Khan",
#     "age": 16,
#     "grade": "A"
# }


# print(student["grade"])
    


# 3.	Add a new key city to the student dictionary and set its value to "New York".

# student = {
#     "name": "Ali Khan",
#     "age": 16,
#     "grade": "A"
# }

# student["city"] = "New York"
# print(student)

# {
#     "name": "Ali Khan",
#     "age": 16,
#     "grade": "A",
#     "city": "New York"
# }



# 4.	Update the value of the age key in the student dictionary to 20.


# student = {
#     "name": "Ali Khan",
#     "age": 16,
#     "grade": "A",
#     "city": "New York"
# }


# student["age"] = 20


# print(student)


# 5.	Remove the key city from the student dictionary.


# student = {
#     "name": "Ali Khan",
#     "age": 16,
#     "grade": "A",
#     "city": "New York"
# }


# student["age"] = 20


# print(student)
