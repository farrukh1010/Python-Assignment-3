#   Questions

# Basic Operations

# 1.	Create a dictionary student with keys: name, age, and grade. Assign them appropriate values.


# student = {
#     "name": "Ali Khan",
#     "age": 16,
#     "grade": "A"
# }

# print(student)
   

# 2.	Access the value of the key grade in the student dictionary.


# student = {
#     "name": "Ali Khan",
#     "age": 16,
#     "grade": "A"
# }


# print(student["grade"])
    


# 3.	Add a new key city to the student dictionary and set its value to "New York".

# student = {
#     "name": "Ali Khan",
#     "age": 16,
#     "grade": "A"
# }

# student["city"] = "New York"
# print(student)

# {
#     "name": "Ali Khan",
#     "age": 16,
#     "grade": "A",
#     "city": "New York"
# }



# 4.	Update the value of the age key in the student dictionary to 20.


# student = {
#     "name": "Ali Khan",
#     "age": 16,
#     "grade": "A",
#     "city": "New York"
# }


# student["age"] = 20


# print(student)


# 5.	Remove the key city from the student dictionary.


# student = {
#     "name": "Ali Khan",
#     "age": 16,
#     "grade": "A",
#     "city": "New York"
# }


# student["age"] = 20


# print(student)


# Iterating through Dictionaries
# 6.	Iterate through the dictionary student and print all keys.
# Example dictionary
# student = {
#     "name": "John Doe",
#     "age": 20,
#     "major": "Computer Science",
#     "gpa": 3.8
# }


# for key in student:
#     print(key)




# 7.	Iterate through the dictionary student and print all values.

# student = {
#     "name": "John Doe",
#     "age": 20,
#     "major": "Computer Science",
#     "gpa": 3.8
# }


# for value in student.values():
#     print(value)


# 8.	Iterate through the dictionary student and print all key-value pairs in the format key: value.

# student = {
#     "name": "John Doe",
#     "age": 20,
#     "major": "Computer Science",
#     "gpa": 3.8
# }


# for key, value in student.items():
#     print(f"{key}: {value}")


# 9.	Check if the key grade exists in the student dictionary and print True or False.



# student = {
#     "name": "John Doe",
#     "age": 20,
#     "major": "Computer Science",
#     "gpa": 3.8
# }


# key_exists = "grade" in student
# print(key_exists)



# 10.	Count the total number of keys in the student dictionary.



# student = {
#     "name": "John Doe",
#     "age": 20,
#     "major": "Computer Science",
#     "gpa": 3.8
# }


# total_keys = len(student)
# print(total_keys)
